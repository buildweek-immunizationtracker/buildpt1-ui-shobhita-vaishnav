      <h2>Importance of Immunization</h2>
      <p align="justify">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You want to do what is best for your children. You know about
        the importance of car seats, baby gates and other
        ways to keep them safe. But, did you know that one of the best ways to protect your children is to make sure
        they have all of their vaccinations at right time?
      </p>
      <p align="justify">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immunizations can save your child’s life. Because of advances in
        medical science, your child can be protected
        against more diseases than ever before. Some diseases that once injured or killed thousands of children have
        been eliminated completely and others are close to extinction– primarily due to safe and effective vaccines.
        Polio is one example of the great impact that vaccines have had in the United States. Polio was once America’s
        most-feared disease, causing death and paralysis across the country, but today, thanks to vaccination, there are
        no reports of polio in the United States.
      </p>
      <p align="justify">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vaccination is very safe and effective. Scientists, doctors, and
        healthcare professionals only give vaccines to
        children after a long and careful review. Vaccines will involve some discomfort and may cause pain, redness, or
        tenderness at the site of injection but this is minimal compared to the pain, discomfort, and trauma of the
        diseases these vaccines prevent. Serious side effects following vaccination, such as severe allergic reaction,
        are very rare. The disease-prevention benefits of getting vaccines are much greater than the possible side
        effects for almost all children.
      </p>
      <p align="justify">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immunization protects others you care about. Children in the
        U.S. still get vaccine-preventable diseases. In
        fact, we have seen resurgences of measles and whooping cough (pertussis) over the past few years. Since 2010,
        there have been between 10,000 and 50,000 cases of whooping cough each year in the United States and about 10 to
        20 babies, many of which were too young to be fully vaccinated, died each year.
      </p>
      <p align="justify">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While some babies are too young to be protected by vaccination,
        others may not be able to receive certain
        vaccinations due to severe allergies, weakened immune systems from conditions like leukemia, or other reasons.
        To help keep them safe, it is important that you and your children who are able to get vaccinated are fully
        immunized. This not only protects your family, but also helps prevent the spread of these diseases to your
        friends and loved ones.
      </p>
      <p align="justify">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immunizations can save your family time and money. A child with
        a vaccine-preventable disease can be denied
        attendance at schools or childcare facilities. Some vaccine-preventable diseases can result in prolonged
        disabilities and can take a financial toll because of lost time at work, medical bills or long-term disability
        care. In contrast, getting vaccinated against these diseases is a good investment and usually covered by
        insurance. The Vaccines for Children program is a federally funded program that provides vaccines at no cost to
        children from low-income families.
      </p>
      <p align="justify">
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Immunization protects future generations. Vaccines have reduced
        and, in some cases, eliminated many diseases
        that killed or severely disabled people just a few generations ago. For example, smallpox vaccination eradicated
        that disease worldwide. Your children don’t have to get smallpox shots any more because the disease no longer
        exists. By vaccinating children against rubella (German measles), the risk that pregnant women will pass this
        virus on to their fetus or newborn has been dramatically decreased, and birth defects associated with that virus
        no longer are seen in the United States. If we continue vaccinating now, and vaccinating completely, parents in
        the future may be able to trust that some diseases of today will no longer be around to harm their children in
        the future.
